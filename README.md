# Credit-Default-Analysis-in-BFSI

Introduction
All BFSI (Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance) institutions face a persistent and critical challenge: managing and mitigating loan defaults. A default occurs when a borrower fails to meet scheduled payments on their loan, impacting the financial health of lending institutions. Across various loan types such as personal, education, vehicle, and business loans, an average default rate of 2-5% is commonly observed. While it is impossible to eliminate defaults entirely, maintaining them at the lowest possible levels is crucial for sustained cash flow and overall financial stability.

Broad Types of Loans
1. Secured Loan
A secured loan requires the borrower to provide collateral to the bank as a guarantee against the loan amount. This collateral remains with the bank until the loan is fully repaid. If the borrower defaults on payments, the bank has the right to seize the collateral after a grace period (usually 4-5 months). A common example of a secured loan is a home loan.

2. Unsecured Loan
In contrast, an unsecured loan does not require any collateral from the borrower. These loans typically have lower sanctioned amounts due to the higher risk involved. An example of an unsecured loan is a two-wheeler loan.

Credit Default Definition
In the BFSI sector, a borrower is classified as a defaulter when they miss one or more scheduled payments. Default can occur with either secured or unsecured loans. For secured loans, if the borrower continues to default beyond the grace period, the bank is authorized to claim the collateral. With unsecured loans, the consequences of default can be severe and may include being reported to credit bureaus, making it difficult for the borrower to secure future loans, and in significant cases, facing legal action initiated by the bank.

Role of Credit Bureaus
Credit Bureaus play a pivotal role in addressing the problem of loan defaults. These regulated organizations—such as TransUnion CIBIL, Equifax, Experian, and CRIF—collect, store, and share information on borrowers’ credit activities. They aggregate data from various banks and non-banking financial institutions (NBFCs) and compile it into comprehensive credit reports.

These credit reports include a 'Credit Score' that reflects the borrower’s creditworthiness based on predefined rules and data models. Banks and financial institutions are mandated to periodically report their borrowers’ credit activities to the credit bureaus, ensuring that the bureaus have a complete and updated view of each borrower’s financial behavior. When a bank requests information from a credit bureau, it receives consolidated data from all reporting institutions, providing a well-rounded assessment of the borrower.

Why Banks Prefer Internal Mechanisms Over Credit Scores
Although credit scores provided by credit bureaus are useful, banks often prefer to develop their internal risk assessment mechanisms. This approach allows banks to leverage their proprietary expertise and maintain a competitive edge, as credit scores alone do not offer exclusive insight—all financial institutions have access to the same credit scores. By using internal models based on historical data and proprietary risk factors, banks can enhance their decision-making processes and better manage the risk of default.
